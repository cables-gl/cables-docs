## What is Cables Standalone?

Cables [Standalone](https://cables.gl/standalone) is an electron build of the [cables editor](https://github.com/cables-gl/cables_ui), , [cables core](https://github.com/cables-gl/cables) and all the [Ops](https://cables.gl/ops) that make up cables.gl.

Some use-cases for the standalone version are:

- Use it to work on [exported patches](../../4_export_embed/dev_embed/export_standalone/export_standalone) while offline.
- Use it to run installations or vj-sets without access to [cables.gl](https://cables.gl).
- Keep your assets in local files, no need to upload to a web server...ensuring privacy.
- Make use of native features using npm packages and not being bound by browser-sandboxing.
- Develop your own Ops using your editor of choice.
- Contribute to cables-development using the standalone as your [development environment](../../6_1_developing_cables/developing_cables).
- Keep a certain version of cables next to [your project](../../4_export_embed/dev_embed/export_standalone/export_standalone) for backup purposes.

While the standalone facilitates for offline use and local development of patches, it's still possible to [import](https://dev.cables.gl/mydata#import) your
work "back" to cables.gl and share it with the community, gather likes and comments and help others to learn via your work.
