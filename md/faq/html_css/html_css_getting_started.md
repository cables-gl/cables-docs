The ops that you'll need to use most of the time are:

- [DivElement op](https://cables.gl/op/Ops.Html.DivElement_v3) - this allows you to place a Div inside of the cables canvas
- [CSS op](https://cables.gl/op/Ops.Html.CSS_v2) - This allows you to write a CSS stylesheet which all other elements can access in your patch 
- [ElementChilds Op](https://cables.gl/op/Ops.Html.ElementChilds_v2) - Mainly used to make a container with a div and then place other div's inside of it.
- [CSS property op](https://cables.gl/op/Ops.Html.CSSProperty_v2) - this allows you to change the css style properties of an element
- [Hyperlink op](https://cables.gl/op/Ops.Html.HyperLink_v2) - Allows you to open another website.
