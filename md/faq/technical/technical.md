# Technical questions

#### What kind of system specs would I need to use cables?

- That depends on what you making with it and how good you are at optimizing your patches.
Patches that have a lot of 3D models and shader effects will need a decent GPU and RAM to work.
Then again a lot of amazing patches run on mobile devices so it's all down to the users experience level.

#### Do I need a good graphics card (GPU) to use cables?

- We'd advise having a the equivalent of a **Nvdia 970M** for any serious graphics work.

#### What kind of input devices can I use with cables?

- Game controllers, midi controllers, mobile phone data such as a gyroscope. See this [page](https://cables.gl/ops/Ops.Device) for a full list of supported devices.
