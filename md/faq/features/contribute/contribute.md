# How to contribute code to cables

So you found something missing in cables, integrated a new technology or fixed a bug? Awesome!

The easiest way to contribute this to the community is to [create a team](https://cables.gl/myteams) and then:

- clone or rename your ops to the [team namespace](../../../5_1_permissions/3_ops/ops)
- [make the team public](../../../5_1_permissions/2_teams/teams), so people can join and use your ops
- promote your ops, have people join your team, collect feedback, gather collaborators

If it's a really small fix, you can create a pull-request directly in github. Check out the [YouTube-Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4Wc5JwZWaU) on how to
quickly contribute to the cables documentation, for an example.

For more complex bugfixes or improvements in core ops, the editor or the standalone version, read up on how to [develop cables](../../../6_1_developing_cables/developing_cables) 
and create a pull request for the affected repository.

Thanks for contributing!
