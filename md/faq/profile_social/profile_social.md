# My User Profile & Social Media

## Customizing your profile on cables.gl

When you create a new account on cables.gl your access to the editor also comes with your own profile page. You can customize links to your website or portfolio, add social media links and select a cables patch from your library as the header of your page. As people browse and check out your patches they will discover your user profile and be greeted by your chosen header patch -so have some fun and be nice (maybe don't use a 20mb 3d model).

## Social Media links on your profile

You might have seen that we periodically post and celebrate patches from our community on our own [social](https://www.instagram.com/cables_gl/) [mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@cables_gl) [pages](https://www.facebook.com/cablesgl). If you include links to your social media on your profile, we will be sure to include those in our posts so more of the online art and design community takes notice and follows your work!

# When you publish on social sites - let us know!

When you share your patches and videos of your cables projects, use the hashtag #cablesgl so we can get a notification and our community can get your content in their feeds! If you post stories on Insta, mentioning us is a nice way to alert us to reshare too!
